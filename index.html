          Depeche Mode Announce First Live Shows in Five Years - 'Memento Mori'
          World Tour to Kick Off March 23, 2023 In Sacramento, CA
        </h1>
        <p>
          BERLIN, GERMANY (October 4, 2022) - Rock & Roll Hall of Fame Class of
          2020 inductees Depeche Mode announced today at a special event in
          Berlin that they will be releasing a new album and embarking on a
          world tour in 2023. The Memento Mori Tour will support the band's
          forthcoming 15th studio album, Memento Mori, due out in Spring 2023.
        </p>
        <p>
          In a break from tradition, Dave Gahan and Martin Gore revealed today
          that the Live Nation-presented tour will begin with a special, limited
          series of North American arena dates starting March 23rd, before the
          band heads to Europe for their summer stadium tour. These limited
          North American dates will feature stops at New York's Madison Square
          Garden, Chicago's United Center, Los Angeles' Kia Forum and Toronto's
          Scotiabank Arena, among others. The band will then begin their
          European stadium tour on May 16th, with noted stops including the
          Stade de France in Paris, Berlin's Olympic Stadium, Milan's San Siro
          Stadium, and London's Twickenham Stadium.
        </p>
        <p>
          In speaking about Memento Mori, Martin Gore commented, "We started
          work on this project early in the pandemic, and its themes were
          directly inspired by that time. After Fletch's passing, we decided to
          continue as we're sure this is what he would have wanted, and that has
          really given the project an extra level of meaning." Dave Gahan added,
          "Fletch would have loved this album. We're really looking forward to
          sharing it with you soon, and we can't wait to present it to you live
          at the shows next year."
        </p>
        <p>
          The Memento Mori Tour will be Depeche Mode's 19th tour and their first
          in over five years. The band's most recent outing, the 2017-2018
          Global Spirit Tour was its longest to date and was one of the year's
          highest grossing tours, with the band playing to more than 3 million
          fans over the course of 130 shows across Europe and North America.
        </p>
        <p>
          Memento Mori will be Depeche Mode's 15th studio album and the
          follow-up to 2017's critically acclaimed Spirit, which reached #1 in
          11 territories, charting in the Top 5 in more than 20 others. Memento
          Mori will be released worldwide in Spring 2023 via Columbia Records.
        </p>
        <p>
          Having sold more than 100 million records and played to more than 35
          million fans worldwide, Depeche Mode remains an ever-evolving and
          singularly influential musical force. An indelible inspiration to
          fans, critics and artists alike, Depeche Mode continues to forge
          ahead, with the Memento Mori album and tour representing the opening
          of the newest chapter of a peerless and ongoing legacy.
